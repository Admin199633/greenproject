## [2026-06-16] Numbering Rule — Numeric Start Advances By One

FILES:
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/lib/validations/business.ts`
- `src/lib/validations/business.test.ts`
- `src/services/document.service.ts`
- `src/services/document.service.test.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx`
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md`

DONE:
- Updated numbering semantics to match the business rule:
  a configured numeric start/base value is the current/last number, and the
  first future generated document uses `startNumber + 1`.
- Numeric-only prefix values are never treated as prefixes. They are moved into
  the matching start/base number and the prefix is cleared.
- Changed `issueDraft()` so a new `DocumentCounter` starts at
  `startNumber + 1`.
- Updated the low-counter correction path so existing counters below the
  configured base are advanced inside the existing issue transaction to
  `startNumber + 1`.
- Changed Business start-number Prisma defaults from `1` to `0` so businesses
  without configured values keep old behavior: first generated number is still
  `0001` for text-prefixed defaults.
- Removed client-side full normalization before submit so invalid numeric input
  is validated by the server schema instead of being silently converted.
- Updated settings labels to clarify these are text prefixes and numeric base
  values.
- Added `businessSchema` tests for:
  numeric prefix with spaces, numeric prefix with leading zeros, mixed
  text+numeric prefix (`REC80156`), oversized numeric-only prefix rejection, and
  negative start-number rejection.

BEHAVIOR CHANGED:
- `receiptNumberPrefix = "80156"` normalizes to `receiptNumberPrefix = ""`,
  `receiptStartNumber = 80156`; the first future receipt is `80157`, then
  `80158`.
- Empty prefix with `receiptStartNumber = 80156` generates `80157`, then
  `80158`.
- Text prefix with `receiptStartNumber = 6` generates `REC-0007`; text prefixes
  still keep the existing four-digit padding.
- Mixed values containing non-numeric characters, like `REC80156`, remain text
  prefixes.

NOT CHANGED:
- Existing issued documents are not edited or renumbered.
- `DocumentCounter` remains the source of numbering state.
- Counter create/update/correction still happens inside the existing
  `issueDraft()` DB transaction.
- Unique constraints, duplicate conflict handling, validation guards, and draft
  immutability remain intact.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm test` — 7/7 suites, 80/80 tests pass.
- `npm run build` — passed. Prisma Client regenerated successfully. Build still
  prints pre-existing non-fatal `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` notices for report/export
  API routes that use `headers`.

## [2026-06-16] Numeric Prefix Numbering Guard

FILES:
- `src/lib/validations/business.ts`
- `src/services/business.service.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
- `src/services/document.service.ts`
- `src/services/document.service.test.ts`
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md`

DONE:
- Audited the numbering flow after the start-number implementation:
  settings form payload, business validation, `updateBusiness()`,
  `DocumentCounter` creation/update, `formatDocumentNumber()`, and
  `issueDraft()`.
- Added shared `normalizeBusinessNumbering()` logic.
- Prefix fields now allow real text prefixes or an intentionally empty string.
  Empty prefix is preserved instead of falling back to `REC-` / `INV-` /
  `QUO-` / `INVR-`.
- Numeric-only prefix values such as `80156` are normalized to:
  prefix `""` and start number `80157`.
- The settings form normalizes before submit, the settings page normalizes
  legacy DB values before display, and `updateBusiness()` normalizes before
  persistence.
- `issueDraft()` also normalizes at issue time so stale numeric-only prefix
  values already stored in the database cannot generate values like
  `801560001`.
- `formatDocumentNumber()` now returns plain numeric strings when prefix is
  empty. Example: prefix `""`, start `80157` -> `80157`, then `80158`.
- Inside the existing issue transaction, if an old `DocumentCounter` value is
  below the normalized start number, the counter is advanced to the start
  number before assigning the future document number. Existing issued documents
  are not edited or renumbered.

BEHAVIOR CHANGED:
- If receipt prefix is set to numeric-only `80156`, the next future receipt is
  `80157`, not `801560001`.
- If receipt prefix is empty and `receiptStartNumber = 80157`, the first
  receipt is `80157`; the next receipt is `80158`.
- The same numeric-only-prefix protection applies to quote, invoice, receipt,
  and invoice receipt numbering.
- Text prefixes still work as before: prefix `REC-`, start `7` -> `REC-0007`.

NOT CHANGED:
- `DocumentCounter` remains the numbering state source.
- Counter mutation still happens inside the existing `issueDraft()` DB
  transaction.
- Duplicate number conflict handling, unique constraints, issue validation
  guards, and issued-document immutability remain in place.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 75/75 tests pass.
- `npm run build` — passed. Prisma Client regenerated successfully. Build still
  prints pre-existing non-fatal `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` notices for report/export
  API routes that use `headers`.

## [2026-06-16] Document Numbering Start Numbers

FILES:
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/lib/validations/business.ts`
- `src/services/business.service.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
- `src/services/document.service.ts`
- `src/services/document.service.test.ts`
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md`

DONE:
- Added separate Business start-number settings for all issued document types:
  `quoteStartNumber`, `receiptStartNumber`, `invoiceStartNumber`, and
  `invoiceReceiptStartNumber`, each defaulting to `1`.
- Kept existing prefix settings as prefix-only values:
  `quoteNumberPrefix`, `receiptNumberPrefix`, `invoiceNumberPrefix`, and
  `invoiceReceiptNumberPrefix`.
- Wired the new start-number fields through business settings validation,
  `updateBusiness()`, the settings page defaults, and the settings form payload.
- Reworked the settings form numbering section so each document type has a
  prefix input and a numeric start-number input.
- Updated `issueDraft()` numbering so a missing `DocumentCounter` is created
  with the relevant configured start number. Existing counters still use the
  same transactional increment path.
- Added issuance tests covering Quote, Receipt, Invoice, and Invoice Receipt:
  each starts from its configured start number and the second issued document
  increments correctly.

BEHAVIOR CHANGED:
- A business can now set `quoteNumberPrefix = "QUO-"` and
  `quoteStartNumber = 1165`; the first quote number is `QUO-1165`, then
  `QUO-1166`, `QUO-1167`, etc.
- The same prefix/start-number split applies to receipts, invoices, and invoice
  receipts.
- Businesses that do not configure start numbers keep the existing fallback:
  the first counter starts at `1`, so current default output remains
  `INV-0001`, `REC-0001`, `QUO-0001`, or `INVR-0001`.

NOT CHANGED:
- `DocumentCounter` remains the source of sequential numbering state.
- `issueDraft()` still performs counter upsert, document update, payment
  creation for receipt types, and duplicate-number conflict handling inside the
  existing DB transaction.
- The `(businessId, number)` unique constraint, duplicate conflict mapping,
  issueDraft validation guards, and draft immutability protections are
  preserved.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 66/66 tests pass.
- `npm run build` — passed. Prisma Client regenerated successfully. The build
  still prints pre-existing non-fatal `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` notices for
  report/export API routes that use `headers`.

NOTES:
- This working copy has no `prisma/migrations` directory, so the Prisma schema
  was updated directly. The target database still needs the equivalent
  migration / `prisma db push` before deploying this code.

---

## [2026-06-14] Public DB Health Endpoint

FILES:
- `src/app/api/health/db/route.ts`
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md`

DONE:
- Added public `GET /api/health/db`.
- The route does not call `requireSession()` / `requireBusiness()` and is not covered by the dashboard-only middleware matcher, so it does not require login.
- The route performs a minimal Prisma raw query: `SELECT 1`.
- On success it returns `200` JSON `{ ok: true }`.
- On failure it returns `500` JSON `{ ok: false }`.
- Error details, DB metadata, env vars, user/session data, and table data are never returned.
- Added `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` so external cron pings execute the DB check instead of using a cached route response.

NOT CHANGED:
- Prisma schema, migrations, RLS/database policy, auth services, middleware, and existing protected routes.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` — first sandboxed run failed because Next could not fetch Google Fonts (`EACCES`). Reran with network approval; build passed and route table includes `/api/health/db`.
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 62/62 tests pass.
- Deployed URL check on 2026-06-14:
  - `https://liorsw.com/api/health/db` — `404 Not Found`.
  - `https://liorsw.com/green/api/health/db` — `404 Not Found`.
- The deployed checks indicate the new route is not deployed to production yet.

---

## [2026-05-10] Documents List - Payment Date Column

FILES:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/documents/page.tsx`
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md`

DONE:
- Added a new `מועד תשלום` column to the desktop documents list table between `תאריך` and `סה״כ`.
- The cell value renders from `document.eventDate` and uses the existing shared `formatDate()` helper.
- When `eventDate` is missing, the table shows `—`.
- Confirmed no query/API/schema change was needed because the existing `listDocuments()` query already returns `eventDate`.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` - failed twice in this environment with `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename ... node_modules/.prisma/client/query_engine-windows.dll.node`. The failure happens during `prisma generate` before `next build`.
- `npm test` - passed (`6/6` suites, `62/62` tests).

## [2026-04-29] Configurable Approval WhatsApp Template In Business Settings

FILES:
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/lib/validations/business.ts`
- `src/services/business.service.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/documents/DocumentShareActions.tsx`
- `src/lib/documents/delivery.ts`
- `src/lib/documents/delivery.test.ts`

DONE:
- Added `Business.approvalWhatsappMessageTemplate String? @db.Text` so each business can store a customer-facing WhatsApp template for quote approval links.
- Wired the new field through the existing business settings PATCH flow.
- `/green/settings` now includes a textarea titled `הודעת וואטסאפ לשליחת הצעת מחיר` with the documented variables `{customerName}`, `{approvalUrl}`, `{eventDate}`, `{eventTime}`, `{eventLocation}`, `{businessName}`.
- `DocumentShareActions` now receives the business template plus quote/business context from the document detail page and builds the customer WhatsApp approval message from that template.
- Added centralized template rendering in `src/lib/documents/delivery.ts` with an emoji-rich default template fallback, token replacement, and safe fallbacks (`לקוח` for `customerName`, `—` for the other variables).
- `buildWhatsappShareUrl()` remains the only place that applies `encodeURIComponent`.

NOT CHANGED:
- Phone normalization in `normalizeWhatsappPhone()` is untouched.
- The post-approval owner WhatsApp redirect flow is untouched.
- The pre-`window.open` WhatsApp debug logging in `DocumentShareActions` remains in place.

VERIFICATION:
- `npx prisma generate` — clean.
- `npm run build` — succeeds.
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 62/62 tests pass.

NOTES:
- Database still needs `npx prisma db push` in the target environment so the new nullable `approvalWhatsappMessageTemplate` column exists before settings writes to it.

## [2026-04-29] Approval Share — WhatsApp Message Body Replaced

FILES:
- src/lib/documents/delivery.ts (`buildApprovalShareMessage`)

DONE:
- The approval-link WhatsApp message produced by `buildApprovalShareMessage` (the helper invoked by the **שלח קישור אישור** button on the document detail page) now uses the new copy verbatim:
  ```
  היי {customerName} 👋

  שלחתי לך הצעת מחיר מפוטופ 📸

  לצפייה בפרטי ההצעה ואישור התאריך:
  {approvalUrl}

  לאחר האישור התאריך יישמר עבורך ✅

  לכל שאלה אני כאן 🙂
  ```
- `customerName` now accepts `string | null | undefined`; when the trimmed value is empty the helper falls back to `"לקוח"`. `approvalUrl` stays a dynamic, required string and is interpolated as-is into the body.
- `DocumentShareActions` keeps calling `buildWhatsappShareUrl(phone, message)`, which still applies `encodeURIComponent` to the message and feeds the existing `normalizeWhatsappPhone` for the customer's phone. The button click flow (open-WhatsApp on phone available, copy-link + toast fallback otherwise) is unchanged.

NOT CHANGED:
- Phone normalization in `normalizeWhatsappPhone` (`+972 → 972`, `0XX → 972XX`, `972` passthrough, non-digits stripped) — untouched.
- Button label, ordering, styling, and behavior — untouched.
- The unrelated `buildApprovalWhatsappMessage` helper (used by tests / email) — untouched. The two helpers now produce the same body string but `buildApprovalShareMessage` is the sole one called from the document detail action.
- Public approval page and post-approval owner redirect flows — untouched.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` — clean.
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 59/59 tests pass.

---

## [2026-04-29] Document Detail — Approval Action Becomes WhatsApp Send

FILES:
- src/lib/documents/delivery.ts (new `buildApprovalShareMessage` helper)
- src/components/documents/DocumentShareActions.tsx
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx (passes `customerName` + `customerPhone` again)

DONE:
- The primary action on the document detail page (first in the action order) is now **"שלח קישור אישור"** instead of "העתק קישור אישור". Clicking it:
  1. Resolves the approval URL via the existing `POST /api/documents/[id]/approval-link` route (cached in component state after the first call).
  2. Builds the message:
     ```
     הי {customerName}
     מצורפת הצעת המחיר לאישור:
     {approvalUrl}

     לאישור ההצעה יש ללחוץ על הקישור.
     ```
  3. Opens `https://wa.me/{normalizedPhone}?text=...` in a new tab via `window.open(url, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer")`.
- **Phone normalization** uses the existing `normalizeWhatsappPhone` (in `delivery.ts`) which already implements the spec: strip non-digits, drop leading `+`, treat `00…` as international, and rewrite a leading `0` to `972` (so `0501234567` → `972501234567`). Numbers already starting with `972` are passed through unchanged. The URL itself is constructed by the existing `buildWhatsappShareUrl` helper.
- **Fallback when the customer has no phone**: copies the approval URL to the clipboard (using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, with a `textarea` + `execCommand('copy')` fallback for older browsers) and shows the toast `"אין מספר טלפון ללקוח, הקישור הועתק"`. The copy-only behavior is no longer the primary path; it only runs as the explicit fallback.
- New helper **`buildApprovalShareMessage({ customerName, approvalUrl })`** added to `src/lib/documents/delivery.ts`. It returns the exact 4-line format above, with the `הי {name}` greeting falling back to a bare `היי` if the name is empty/whitespace.
- `DocumentShareActions` props updated to `{ documentId, customerName, customerPhone, publicPdfToken, approvalUrl?, canCopyApprovalLink? }`. The page passes `doc.customerName ?? getDisplayName(doc.customer)` and `doc.customer.phone`.

NOT CHANGED:
- The public approval flow under `src/app/approve/[token]/...` — still serves the same approval page, signature flow, and post-approval redirect. The button only links the customer to that page.
- The post-approval owner redirect (`buildOwnerApprovalRedirectWhatsappMessage`, `buildApprovedQuoteOwnerWhatsappMessage`) and the approval-time owner WhatsApp open inside `ApprovalForm` are untouched.
- `buildApprovalWhatsappMessage` (the old 👋/📸/✅/🙂 variant) is preserved alongside the new helper because the existing test in `delivery.test.ts` and `email.service.ts` still rely on its exact string. The document detail action does not call it anymore.
- The PDF download button styling/order (action #2 in the bar) is unchanged.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` — clean.
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 59/59 tests pass.

---

## [2026-04-29] QUOTE Form Fields — dueDate Removed, Event Fields Required

FILES:
- src/lib/validations/document.ts (saveDraftSchema)
- src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx

DONE:
- **DocumentForm**:
  - When `type === "QUOTE"`, the **תאריך תשלום** (`dueDate`) input is no longer rendered. The payload likewise omits `dueDate` for QUOTE (`...(isQuote ? {} : { dueDate: dueDate || undefined })`). The companion `dueDate` state, `dueDateTouched`, and the `issueDate → dueDate` sync are kept but become inert for QUOTE.
  - Event fields (**תאריך האירוע**, **מיקום האירוע**, **שעת האירוע**) are now shown for **all** QUOTE drafts — the previous `businessType === "photography"` gate is dropped (replaced with `showQuoteEventFields = type === "QUOTE"`). Other document types still don't show these fields.
  - Each of the three event labels now carries the required indicator (`*`); the two HTML inputs have the `required` attribute. (`Time24Input` is a custom select-pair that doesn't accept `required` — its label still shows `*` and submission is gated by client-side and schema validation, so this matches the existing pattern used elsewhere in the form.)
  - `handleSave` runs Hebrew client-side validation before submitting a QUOTE: `"תאריך האירוע הוא שדה חובה"`, `"מיקום האירוע הוא שדה חובה"`, `"שעת האירוע היא שדה חובה"`. Errors surface in the existing `error` banner (matches the pattern used for receipt fields).
  - `businessType` prop is still accepted from `new` and `edit` pages but is no longer read inside the form — left in place to avoid touching unrelated callers.

- **saveDraftSchema** (`superRefine`):
  - Added a QUOTE branch (runs before the existing receipt branch). When `data.type === "QUOTE"`:
    - `eventDate` empty/whitespace → issue at `path: ["eventDate"]`, message `"תאריך האירוע הוא שדה חובה"`.
    - `eventLocation` trimmed length `< 1` → issue at `path: ["eventLocation"]`, message `"מיקום האירוע הוא שדה חובה"`.
    - `eventTime` empty/whitespace → issue at `path: ["eventTime"]`, message `"שעת האירוע היא שדה חובה"`.
  - The existing receipt-fields validation (`receiptAmountReceived`, `receiptPaymentMethod`) is unchanged — the early-return was rewritten so the QUOTE branch can run alongside it.

NOT CHANGED:
- DB schema (`Document.eventDate / eventLocation / eventTime` remain nullable).
- Other document types: INVOICE / RECEIPT / INVOICE_RECEIPT / CREDIT_NOTE keep their existing `dueDate` input and behavior, and never see the event-field requirement.
- `eventHours` remains optional and is not rendered as an input today; it continues to be sent through the payload spread when populated.
- API routes (`POST /api/documents`, `PATCH /api/documents/[id]`) — the schema change is picked up automatically; both routes already return `422` with `flatten().fieldErrors` on validation failure.
- Service layer (`createDraft` / `updateDraft`) handles undefined `dueDate` correctly today (`null` is persisted), so no service change was needed.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` — clean.
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 59/59 tests pass.

---

## [2026-04-29] Document Detail — Action Buttons Cleanup

FILES:
- src/components/documents/DocumentShareActions.tsx (refactored)
- src/components/documents/SendDocumentButton.tsx (deleted — unused)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx (props trimmed)

DONE:
- Removed the email send button (SendDocumentButton) and the WhatsApp share button from the document detail page action bar (mobile + desktop).
- Replaced the previous "העתקת קישור אישור" button (which opened WhatsApp) with a new primary action **"העתק קישור אישור"** that:
  - Calls the existing `POST /api/documents/[id]/approval-link` route to mint a fresh approval URL when one is not already cached on the client.
  - Copies the URL to the clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText` (with a textarea+`execCommand('copy')` fallback for older browsers).
  - Shows a success toast: **"קישור הועתק"**.
- The new action uses the brand-primary style (`bg-brand-600`); other actions remain in the secondary/outline style.
- Final action order (when each action is applicable):
  1. העתק קישור אישור (primary, quote/issued/not-yet-approved only)
  2. הורדת PDF
  3. צור חשבונית
  4. צור קבלה
  5. צור חשבונית קבלה (when business is not osek_patur — kept alongside Receipt)
  6. שכפל מסמך
  7. צור זיכוי (when applicable — kept before Cancel)
  8. בטל מסמך (when cancelable)
- `DocumentShareActions` props slimmed to `{ documentId, publicPdfToken, approvalUrl?, canCopyApprovalLink? }` — customer name/email/phone, document type/number, and total are no longer passed because the email + WhatsApp share paths were removed from this component.

PRESERVED:
- `/api/documents/[id]/send` route is untouched (backend logic for email delivery remains in place).
- `/api/documents/[id]/approval-link` route, `mintQuoteApprovalToken`, and `buildApprovalUrl` are unchanged.
- The mobile action bar still uses `grid-cols-1` → `sm:grid-cols-2` → `lg:flex flex-wrap`, so buttons stack vertically on mobile, two-up on tablet, and wrap at desktop without overflow. All buttons keep `min-h-[44px] w-full` on mobile for touch targets.

VERIFICATION:
- `npm run build` — clean (only the pre-existing `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` notice on `/api/reports/revenue`, unrelated to this change).
- `npm test` — 6/6 suites, 59/59 tests pass.

## [2026-04-12] Legal Document Content — Tasks 3–8 Complete

### Task 3: Invoice Receipt (חשבונית מס/קבלה)
Verified — no changes needed. Payment section (Task 1) already renders for INVOICE_RECEIPT. VAT enforcement (Task 2) applies. PDF route blocks without payments.

### Task 4: Document Titles
Verified — all Hebrew titles correct in DOCUMENT_TYPE_LABELS. Heebo TTF font covers full Hebrew charset, no encoding issues.

### Task 5: Payment Method System
Verified — `PAYMENT_METHODS` const-enum, `z.enum` validation, `Payment.method String` NOT NULL in DB, `paymentMethodLabel()` in PDF. Complete.

### Task 6: PDF Content Enforcement
FILES: src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx
- `issueDate` in PDF header changed from conditional to unconditional render (`formatDate` returns "—" if null, but always present on issued docs).
- All required fields (business name/taxId, number, date, customer name, totals) verified always present.

### Task 7: Validation Layer
Verified — all compliance rules enforce at service/API level:
- issueDraft: 5 backend checks (name, taxId, date, items, VAT rule)
- createPayment: enum method, amount, doc eligibility, balance, idempotency
- PDF route: receipt payment existence + method validity

### Task 8: Verification
Build: CLEAN. Tests: 43/43.

---

## [2026-04-12] Legal Document Content — Task 2: Invoice (חשבונית מס) Compliance

FILES: src/services/document.service.ts

DONE:
- **2.1 Required fields**: all verified present in PDF — title ("חשבונית מס"), number, issue date, business name/taxId/address (snapshots), customer name/taxId/address (snapshots), subtotal, VAT rate label, VAT amount (conditional), total.
- **2.2 VAT rules**: 
  - Exempt (`osek_patur`, `vatRateSnapshot=0`): VAT row already hidden by `{Number(document.vatRateSnapshot) > 0 && ...}` conditional in PDF template.
  - Authorized (`osek_murshe` / `chevra`): new backend enforcement in `issueDraft` — if `isAuthorizedBusiness && isInvoiceType && vatRateSnapshot <= 0` → pushed to `validationErrors` → 422 with message "עסק מורשה חייב לכלול מע״מ בחשבונית".

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean. npm test — 43/43.

---

## [2026-04-12] Legal Document Content — Task 1: Receipt (קבלה) Compliance

FILES: src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx, src/app/api/documents/[id]/pdf/route.ts, src/services/document.service.test.ts

DONE:
- **PdfDocumentData** type extended to include `payments: Payment[]`. Import added.
- **PAYMENT_METHOD_LABELS** imported in PDF template. `paymentMethodLabel()` helper converts stored method key (e.g. "cash") to Hebrew label (e.g. "מזומן").
- **"פרטי תשלום" section** added to PDF for RECEIPT and INVOICE_RECEIPT types when payments exist. Shows table: תאריך | אמצעי תשלום | אסמכתא | סכום. Final row shows "סה״כ התקבל" = `amountPaid`.
- **PDF route validation** (Task 1.3): for RECEIPT/INVOICE_RECEIPT, returns 400 if no payments exist or any payment has an invalid/missing method. Checked against `PAYMENT_METHODS` set.
- Required fields verified: title ("קבלה" via `DOCUMENT_TYPE_LABELS`), number (sequential), date (issueDate), business name/taxId, customer name, amount received (`amountPaid`), payment method — all present.
- Tests fixed: `issueDraft` mocks updated to include `mockItem` (full Decimal fields) and `mockDocTotals` required by `computeIssuedDocumentHash`.

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean. npm test — 43/43.

## [2026-04-12] Bootstrap TASKS.md + PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md

* Done: Created TASKS.md with phases 10–13 and backlog. Created this file.
* Why: Establishing task tracking workflow for session.
* Files: TASKS.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md
* New files: TASKS.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY_UPDATE.md
* Notes: Phase 10 (Business Settings) and Phase 12 (Auth) are fully done. Phase 11 missing only the duplicate API route. Phase 13 is QA/verification.

---

## [2026-04-12] Create duplicate document API route

* Done: POST `/api/documents/[id]/duplicate` — calls `duplicateDocument()`, returns `{ id }` with 201. Auth + 404 error handling matches project pattern.
* Why: DuplicateDocumentButton component already existed and called this endpoint.
* Files: `src/app/api/documents/[id]/duplicate/route.ts`
* New files: none (file existed as stub, updated to full implementation)
* Notes: Phase 11 now fully complete.

---

## [2026-04-12] npm run build — passed

* Done: Production build clean. 0 TS errors, 0 lint errors. 17 routes generated.
* Why: Verification step after Phase 11 completion.
* Files: none modified
* New files: none
* Notes: `/api/documents/[id]/duplicate` confirmed in route table.

---

## [2026-04-12] npm run test — 39/39 passed

* Done: All 3 test suites passed, 39 tests, 0 failures.
* Why: Verification step — confirm existing tests unbroken after Phase 11.
* Files: none modified
* New files: none
* Notes: none

---

## [2026-04-12] Auth alignment — partial area #1 complete

AREA: Auth

CURRENT: Custom login/signout routes existed. Cookie options correct (httpOnly, sameSite: lax, secure in prod, maxAge 30 days). `requireSession()` and `requireBusiness()` in auth.service.ts used by all API routes and most pages. `getServerSession(authOptions)` still used in layout.tsx and was being called directly in dashboard/page.tsx.

GAP: `GET /api/auth/me` missing. `dashboard/page.tsx` called `getServerSession` directly instead of `requireSession()`. `[...nextauth]` directory was empty (stale residual).

ACTION:
- Created `GET /api/auth/me` — returns `{ id, email, name, businessId }` from session, 401 if unauthenticated
- Fixed `dashboard/page.tsx` to use `requireSession()` instead of direct `getServerSession` call
- Confirmed `[...nextauth]` directory was already empty; no stale route needed removal
- Build passed: 18 routes, 0 errors

FILES: `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts` (new), `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`

VERIFICATION: `npm run build` — clean, `/api/auth/me` confirmed in route table

SUMMARY UPDATE: Auth partial area complete. GET /api/auth/me added. dashboard/page.tsx aligned to requireSession(). [..nextauth] directory confirmed empty.

## [2026-04-12] Business Settings — fields aligned

AREA: Business Settings

CURRENT: name, taxId, address, phone, email fields existed in schema, validation, service, and form.

GAP: city, postalCode, country, taxType, vatRate, currency, invoiceNumberPrefix, receiptNumberPrefix, quoteNumberPrefix, invoiceReceiptNumberPrefix all missing.

ACTION:
- Added all missing fields to prisma/schema.prisma with appropriate defaults
- Ran prisma generate (types updated)
- Updated businessSchema (lib/validations/business.ts) with all new fields + validation
- Updated updateBusiness service to write all new fields with fallback defaults
- Updated settings/page.tsx to pass all new defaultValues
- Rebuilt BusinessSettingsForm with grouped sections: identity, contact, address, billing, prefixes
- PATCH updates explicit whitelist only — no extra fields possible

FILES: prisma/schema.prisma, src/lib/validations/business.ts, src/services/business.service.ts, src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, 18 routes, 0 TS errors

SUMMARY UPDATE: Business Settings fields aligned. All architecture-spec fields added. Build clean. Migration pending DB start (docker compose up -d then prisma migrate dev).

---

## [2026-04-12] Duplicate Document — verified complete

AREA: Duplicate Document

CURRENT: duplicateDocument() service, POST /api/documents/[id]/duplicate route, DuplicateDocumentButton component, integrated on document detail page.

GAP: None found.

ACTION: Code audit only. Verified all requirements by reading service, route, and button.

FILES: none changed

VERIFICATION: Code review — status=DRAFT, number=null, items copied via createMany, amountPaid=0, businessId filter enforces cross-business protection, router.push to /documents/{id}/edit, isPending + error UI state present.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Duplicate Document verified complete. No gaps. No changes needed.

---

## [2026-04-12] PDF — verified and logo support added

AREA: PDF

CURRENT: PDF generation, RTL, Hebrew font, snapshot-first, status restrictions (draft/cancelled blocked), download filename all existed.

GAP: BuildPdfInput.business only picked name/taxId/address — logo, phone, email not accessible in template. Logo never rendered.

ACTION:
- Added Image import from @react-pdf/renderer
- Expanded BuildPdfInput.business Pick to include logo, phone, email
- Renders logo image when business.logo is set
- Renders business phone and email in PDF header when set
- All other checks passed: draft blocked, cancelled blocked, snapshot-first fallback correct, text wrap natural, page breaks via wrap={false} on rows

FILES: src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, 0 TS errors

---

## [2026-04-12] Dashboard — verified complete

AREA: Dashboard

CURRENT: getDashboardData service, KPI cards, recent documents, recent payments, overdue documents on dashboard page.

GAP: None found.

ACTION: Code audit only.

FILES: none changed

VERIFICATION: All queries scoped to businessId. DRAFT/CANCELLED excluded from KPIs. CREDIT_NOTE excluded from open/overdue. Overdue condition correct (ISSUED/PARTIALLY_PAID + dueDate < today + amountDue > 0). Server component calls service directly — no REST route needed.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Dashboard verified correct. No gaps. No changes needed.

---

## [2026-04-12] Core Customers / Documents / Payments — verified and patched

AREA: Core Customers / Documents / Payments

CURRENT: Full CRUD for customers/documents/payments, filters, search, snapshot logic, status guards, sequential numbering all existed.

GAP: formatDocumentNumber used hardcoded prefixes (INVOICE:"INV", RECEIPT:"REC", etc.) — did not use the business-configured invoiceNumberPrefix / receiptNumberPrefix / quoteNumberPrefix / invoiceReceiptNumberPrefix fields added in Business Settings.

ACTION:
- Replaced NUMBER_PREFIX constant with DEFAULT_NUMBER_PREFIX (matching business settings defaults)
- Added getDocumentPrefix() helper that reads from business object, falls back to defaults
- Updated issueDraft to pass getDocumentPrefix(doc.type, business) to formatDocumentNumber
- All 39 tests pass (mock business without prefix fields correctly falls back to "INV-" etc.)
- Build clean

FILES: src/services/document.service.ts

VERIFICATION: npm test — 39/39. npm run build — clean.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Document numbering now uses business-configured prefixes. Tests green. Build clean.

---

## [2026-04-12] Schema Alignment — verified and indexes added

AREA: Schema Alignment

CURRENT: Full schema for User, Business, Customer, Document, DocumentItem, Payment, DocumentCounter. All money fields Decimal. Unique constraints in place.

GAP: No explicit indexes on FK columns — Customer.businessId, Document.businessId/customerId, Payment.businessId/documentId/customerId. PostgreSQL does not auto-index FK columns.

ACTION:
- Added @@index([businessId]) on Customer, Document, Payment
- Added @@index([businessId, status]) on Document (most common filter pattern)
- Added @@index([customerId]) on Document, Payment
- Added @@index([documentId]) on Payment
- Migration applied: 20260411220350_add_indexes

- All 43 tests pass

FILES: src/services/document.service.test.ts

VERIFICATION: npm test — 43/43 passed.

SUMMARY UPDATE: All 8 partial areas complete. 43 tests passing. Build clean. All migrations applied.

---

---

## [2026-04-12] Customer Details — REST API added

TASK: GET /api/customers/:id

PLAN: Route calls existing getCustomerDetail service, returns customer + documents + payments + openAmount. UI sections already existed.

FILES: src/app/api/customers/[id]/route.ts (new)

DONE: GET /api/customers/:id — auth via requireBusiness(), 404 if not found or wrong business, returns { customer, documents, payments, openAmount }.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, /api/customers/[id] in route table.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Customer REST API added. UI was already complete.

Returns CSV with Hebrew headers: מספר, לקוח, סוג, סטטוס, תאריך, סה״כ. escapeCell() handles commas/quotes/newlines. Content-Type: text/csv; Content-Disposition: attachment. Documents page header now has "ייצוא CSV" link button that passes current filter params to the export endpoint.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, /api/documents/export in route table. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: CSV export complete. API route + UI button wired with active filters.

---

## [2026-04-12] README & Setup

TASK: README & Setup documentation

FILES: README.md (new)

DONE: README covers prerequisites, setup steps (install/env/docker/migrate/seed), env variable table, dev/build/test commands, migration commands, feature overview. Seed credentials documented (admin@example.com / password123).

VERIFICATION: File created. No build changes needed.

---

## [2026-04-12] Production Cleanup

TASK: Remove dead code, debug logs, unused imports; verify no errors

FILES: none changed

DONE: Audited all console.* calls — all are console.error in catch blocks (legitimate, kept). Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK/debugger in codebase. npx tsc --noEmit — 0 errors. npm run build — 0 TS/lint errors. No dead files found. No unused imports detected by compiler.

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit clean. npm run build clean.

FILES: src/app/api/documents/export/route.ts, src/app/(dashboard)/documents/page.tsx

VERIFIED: All 6 required fields present (number, type, customer name, totalAmount, status, issueDate). Empty dataset returns header-only CSV. Content-Disposition: attachment triggers download. Export button on documents page passes active filter params.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Task 1 (CSV Export) confirmed complete. No changes needed.

---

## [2026-04-12] Email Sending — Task 2 complete

TASK: Email Sending (2.1 service + 2.2 API route + 2.3 UI)

FILES:
- src/services/email.service.ts (new)
- src/app/api/documents/[id]/send/route.ts (new)
- src/components/documents/SendDocumentButton.tsx (new)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx (SendDocumentButton added)
- .env.example (SMTP vars added)

DONE:
- sendDocumentEmail(documentId, businessId): validates status (must be issued), resolves customer email (snapshot customerEmail ?? customer.email), generates PDF via renderDocumentPdf, sends via nodemailer. If SMTP_HOST is not set, stubs the send (logs to console.error) and returns { sent: false }
- POST /api/documents/:id/send: calls sendDocumentEmail, maps all error messages to Hebrew 400/404 responses
- SendDocumentButton: client component with loading/success/error states; disabled when customer has no email
- Button rendered in document detail page alongside "הורד PDF" when canDownloadPdf is true
- SMTP config: SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM in .env.example

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, /api/documents/[id]/send in route table. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Email sending complete. Stub mode works without SMTP config. Full send when SMTP_HOST is set.

---

## [2026-04-12] UX Improvements — Task 3 complete

TASK: UX Improvements (3.1 loading, 3.2 error handling, 3.3 empty states)

FILES: src/app/(dashboard)/loading.tsx (new)

DONE:
- 3.1 Loading: Added loading.tsx at (dashboard) group level — single file covers all dashboard routes via Next.js App Router convention. Pulse skeleton with title + content placeholders.
- 3.2 Error handling: Audited all client components (IssueDraftButton, CancelDocumentButton, CancelDocumentButton, DuplicateDocumentButton, AddPaymentForm, CustomerForm, DocumentForm, SendDocumentButton). All already have loading states, inline Hebrew error messages, res.ok checks. Already standardized — no changes needed.
- 3.3 Empty states: All pages already have empty states — customers (context-aware search), documents, payments (filter-aware), reports (per-tab). No changes needed.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Task 3 complete. Loading skeleton added. Error handling and empty states already complete.

---

## [2026-04-12] Document Page Improvements — Task 4 complete

TASK: Document page actions grouping and status display (4.1 + 4.2)

FILES: src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx

DONE:
- 4.1 Actions: Restructured document detail page header into a single grouped flex actions bar. Draft state: Issue → Edit → Duplicate → Delete (ordered by primary action first). Issued state: PDF download → Send Email → Duplicate → Credit Note → Cancel (ordered by common-to-rare usage). All buttons already had disabled states during async operations.
- 4.2 Status display: Audited DocumentStatusBadge — already has distinct color per status (slate/blue/amber/green/red). DOCUMENT_STATUS_LABELS already in Hebrew. Consistent across documents list, detail page, and reports. No changes needed.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean, 0 TS errors.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Task 4 complete. Actions grouped into single bar. Status badges already well-implemented.

---

## [2026-04-12] PDF Enhancements — Task 5 complete

TASK: PDF branding (5.1) and layout fixes (5.2)

FILES: src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx

DONE:
- Branding: Added top accent bar (4px, brand blue #1e40af) via fixed View. Logo moved to dedicated logoWrapper with alignItems flex-end, size increased to 100×48. Business name now uses larger businessName style (14pt bold) separate from title. Document title uses BRAND_COLOR.
- Header: Left block = document type/number/status/date. Right block = logo + business details. Clear visual hierarchy.
- Section titles: now colored with BRAND_COLOR + bottom border for visual separation.
- Table header: dark blue background (#1e40af) with white text instead of light grey — much stronger visual contrast.
- Alternating row background (tableRowAlt, #f8fafc on odd rows) for readability on long documents.
- Totals block: border-wrapped, final row highlighted with light blue background.
- Footer: fixed footer on all pages with business name (right) + page X/Y (left), separated by top border.
- Spacing: paddingVertical on cells increased 7→8, section margin 16→18, page padding adjusted for footer.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: PDF enhanced with brand color, improved logo placement, alternating rows, colored table header, page numbers.

---

## [2026-04-12] Toast Notifications — Task 6 complete

TASK: Basic toast notification system

FILES:
- src/components/ui/Toast.tsx (new)
- src/components/Providers.tsx (ToastProvider added)
- src/components/documents/IssueDraftButton.tsx (toast wired)
- src/components/documents/CancelDocumentButton.tsx (toast wired)
- src/components/documents/SendDocumentButton.tsx (simplified to use toast only)
- src/components/payments/AddPaymentForm.tsx (toast wired)

DONE: ToastProvider context + useToast hook + fixed bottom-right Toaster. Auto-dismiss after 4s, manual dismiss button. Success (green) and error (red) variants. Wired in: issue document (success/error), cancel document (success/error), add payment (success/error), send email (success/error). SendDocumentButton simplified — removed inline success/error messages since toast covers feedback. ToastProvider added to root Providers component (covers all pages).

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Toast system complete. All key actions now show feedback toasts.

---

## [2026-04-12] Business tax behavior for exempt quotes — Task 1 complete

AREA: Business Customization + Quote Improvements — Task 1

FILES: src/app/(dashboard)/documents/new/page.tsx

DONE: NewDocumentPage now computes defaultVatRate from business: "0" when taxType === "osek_patur", otherwise String(Number(business.vatRate)). Passed as defaultValues.vatRateSnapshot to DocumentForm. DocumentForm already initializes vatRateSnapshot from defaultValues, so exempt businesses get 0% pre-filled. Calculations (calcItem with vatRate=0) correctly produce taxAmount=0, subtotal=total. PDF renders 0 VAT naturally from stored vatRateSnapshot. Edit page unaffected (uses document's own stored vatRateSnapshot).

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Exempt quote VAT defaults to 0 for osek_patur businesses. No schema changes required.

---

## [2026-04-12] businessType field — Task 2 complete

AREA: Business Customization — Task 2

FILES:
- prisma/schema.prisma (businessType String @default("general") added to Business)
- prisma/migrations/…add_business_type (migration applied)
- src/lib/validations/business.ts (businessType enum added)
- src/services/business.service.ts (businessType written in updateBusiness)
- src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx (businessType passed as defaultValue)
- src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx (select added, payload + Props updated)

DONE: businessType field with values: general/photography/contractor/consulting/retail/other. Hebrew labels. Rendered as select in settings form alongside taxType. Saved via PATCH /api/business. Loaded on settings page from DB. Migration applied (add_business_type).

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: businessType field fully wired: schema, migration, validation, service, settings page, form.

---

## [2026-04-12] Quote default dates — Task 3 complete

AREA: Business Customization — Task 3

FILES: src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx

DONE: issueDate now defaults to today (new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)) when no defaultValues.issueDate is provided. dueDate defaults to same as issueDate. dueDateTouched flag tracks whether user has manually edited dueDate — while untouched, changing issueDate also updates dueDate. Once user edits dueDate, sync stops. Edit mode: dueDateTouched initialized to true when defaultValues has a dueDate different from issueDate, preserving edit-page behavior.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: New document form now defaults both dates to today, with dueDate synced to issueDate until manually changed.

---

## [2026-04-12] Saved/preset items — Task 4 complete

AREA: Business Customization — Task 4

FILES:
- prisma/schema.prisma (SavedItem model added, Business.savedItems relation)
- prisma/migrations/…add_saved_items (applied)
- src/lib/validations/savedItem.ts (new)
- src/services/savedItem.service.ts (new — list/create/update/delete)
- src/app/api/saved-items/route.ts (new — GET/POST)
- src/app/api/saved-items/[id]/route.ts (new — PATCH/DELETE)
- src/app/(dashboard)/settings/SavedItemsManager.tsx (new — client component)
- src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx (savedItems section added)
- src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx (savedItems prop + preset picker dropdown)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/new/page.tsx (savedItems fetched + passed)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/edit/page.tsx (savedItems fetched + passed)

DONE: SavedItem model: id, businessId, name, description, defaultPrice (Decimal), unit, timestamps, @@index([businessId]). Full CRUD API. Settings page shows saved items list + add form. DocumentForm: when savedItems is non-empty, shows "הוסף מפריט שמור" select above the items table; selecting a preset appends a new item row pre-filled with description and unitPrice. savedItems prop is optional (no-op if empty).

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Saved items fully implemented: schema, migration, API, settings manager UI, document form picker.

---

## [2026-04-12] Photography quote fields — Task 5 complete

AREA: Business Customization — Task 5

FILES:
- prisma/schema.prisma (eventDate DateTime?, eventLocation String?, eventHours Decimal? added to Document)
- prisma/migrations/…add_photography_fields (applied)
- src/lib/validations/document.ts (eventDate/eventLocation/eventHours added to saveDraftSchema)
- src/services/document.service.ts (createDraft + updateDraft write photography fields)
- src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx (businessType prop, showPhotographyFields flag, fields section, state, payload)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/new/page.tsx (businessType prop passed)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/edit/page.tsx (fullBusiness fetched, businessType + eventDate/Location/Hours defaults passed)
- src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx (photography fields shown in detail grid when present)
- src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx (פרטי האירוע section in PDF when fields are set)

DONE: Fields visible only when businessType === "photography" AND type === "QUOTE". Completely invisible for other business types or other document types. Fields saved/loaded in create and edit modes. Detail page shows them when present. PDF includes פרטי האירוע section with all three fields.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Photography quote fields fully wired: schema, migration, form (conditional), detail page, PDF.

---

## [2026-04-12] Fix 1 — Saved item description textarea

FILES: src/app/(dashboard)/settings/SavedItemsManager.tsx

DONE: Description field changed from Input to textarea (rows=3, resize-none). Moved below the 2-col grid so it spans full width. Item list preview changed from truncate to whitespace-pre-wrap line-clamp-2. Description value passed to document form item rows unchanged — multiline text preserves naturally.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Saved item description is now a multiline textarea. Line breaks preserved end-to-end.

---

## [2026-04-12] Fix 2 — Exempt quote VAT row hidden

FILES: src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/documents/new/page.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/edit/page.tsx, src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx

DONE: Added isExempt prop to DocumentForm (default false). When true, the VAT row in the totals section is hidden. new/page.tsx passes isExempt={business.taxType === "osek_patur"}. edit/page.tsx passes isExempt={fullBusiness?.taxType === "osek_patur"}. PDF: wrapped VAT row with {Number(document.vatRateSnapshot) > 0 && (...)} — hides row for exempt businesses where vatRateSnapshot=0.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Exempt businesses no longer show VAT row in quote form totals or PDF.

---

## [2026-04-12] Fix 3 — Photography eventTime field added

FILES: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/20260412000000_add_event_time/migration.sql, src/lib/validations/document.ts, src/services/document.service.ts, src/components/documents/DocumentForm.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/edit/page.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/documents/[id]/page.tsx, src/lib/pdf/document-pdf.tsx

DONE: Added eventTime String? to Document schema. Migration created (ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN "eventTime" TEXT). Validation: eventTime z.string().max(10).optional(). Service: writes eventTime?.trim() || null in both createDraft and updateDraft. DocumentForm: added eventTime state, time input field ("שעת האירוע", type=time) alongside existing eventDate/eventLocation. eventTime sent in payload when showPhotographyFields=true. Edit defaults: eventTime loaded from doc.eventTime. Detail page: shows "שעת האירוע" when eventTime is present. PDF: shows "שעת האירוע" field in פרטי האירוע section when eventTime is set.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Photography quotes now show eventDate, eventLocation, and eventTime (time of day). All three fields save, load, and render in detail page and PDF.

---

## [2026-04-12] Issue Notification — Task 1: Business setting

FILES: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/20260412000001_add_send_issue_notification_email/migration.sql, src/lib/validations/business.ts, src/services/business.service.ts, src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx, src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx

DONE: Added `sendIssueNotificationEmail Boolean @default(false)` to Business schema. Migration created. Validation: `z.boolean().optional().default(false)`. Service writes the field in `updateBusiness`. Settings form: checkbox "שלח אימייל לעסק בעת הנפקת מסמך" in new "התראות" section, reads via `.checked`. Settings page passes `business.sendIssueNotificationEmail ?? false` to form.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean.

SUMMARY UPDATE: sendIssueNotificationEmail setting fully wired: schema, migration, validation, service, settings form, settings page.

---

## [2026-04-12] Issue Notification — Task 2: Notification email service

FILES: src/services/email.service.ts

DONE: Added `sendIssueNotificationEmail(documentId, businessId)` to email.service.ts. Loads document + business in parallel. Returns `{ sent: false }` (no throw) when business.email is missing. Builds plain-text body: typeLabel + docRef + customerName + totalAmount + issueDate + link. Uses shared `createTransport()`. Stub mode (no SMTP_HOST): logs to console.error and returns `{ sent: false }`. Subject: "[הנפקה] {typeLabel} {docRef}". No PDF attachment in this phase.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean.

SUMMARY UPDATE: sendIssueNotificationEmail service done. Never throws — issue flow will not be blocked.

---

## [2026-04-12] Issue Notification — Task 3: Issue flow integration

FILES: src/app/api/documents/[id]/issue/route.ts

DONE: After successful `issueDraft()`, fetches business and checks `sendIssueNotificationEmail`. If true, calls `sendIssueNotificationEmail(doc.id, session.id)` — fire-and-forget via `.catch()`. Errors are logged via `console.error` and do NOT propagate. Issue response is returned immediately after `issueDraft` succeeds, regardless of email outcome.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean.

SUMMARY UPDATE: Notification email integrated into issue flow. Non-blocking. Issue always succeeds.

---

## [2026-04-12] Issue Notification — Task 4: PDF attachment decision

Decision: skip PDF attachment in this phase. Plain-text notification email is sufficient for phase 1. The `sendDocumentEmail` service already handles PDF-attached emails sent to customers; the notification to the business is intentionally lightweight.

---

## [2026-04-12] Issue Notification — Task 5: Verification

VERIFICATION:
- Email disabled (sendIssueNotificationEmail=false): if-guard prevents the call entirely. Issue always returns 200.
- business.email missing: service returns { sent: false } early before transport is needed.
- SMTP missing (no SMTP_HOST): createTransport() returns null → stub logs to console.error → returns { sent: false }. Never throws.
- Email triggered when enabled: route calls sendIssueNotificationEmail fire-and-forget (.catch) when setting is true.
- Issue never blocked: sendIssueNotificationEmail never throws; .catch() wraps the call; response is returned immediately after issueDraft().
- npm run build — clean (✓).
- npm test — 43/43 (✓).

SUMMARY UPDATE: Automatic Issue Notification Email phase complete. All 5 tasks done. Build clean, tests green.

---

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Phase — Tasks 8–10 Complete

### Task 8: Backup Readiness
FILES: scripts/db-backup.sh (new), README.md (backup section added)
DONE: `scripts/db-backup.sh` — sources `.env`, pg_dump with gzip, timestamped to `./backups/`, retains last 30 dumps, cron example. README: backup section with env vars table, cron example, restore command, note to backup `.env` separately.

### Task 9: PDF Compliance
FILES: none changed
VERIFIED: All 6 required fields present: businessName (snapshot+fallback), businessTaxId (snapshot+fallback), document.number (always set at issue), issueDate (formatDate shown in header and details), customerName (snapshot+fallback), totals (subtotal/vat/total/paid/due all rendered). PDF route only allows ISSUED/PARTIALLY_PAID/PAID — at those statuses all snapshot fields are guaranteed populated by issueDraft. No changes needed.

### Task 10: Verification
- Build: CLEAN (no TS/lint errors, all 24 routes listed)
- Tests: 43/43 PASSED

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 7 — Soft Delete Policy

FILES: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/20260412000004_soft_delete_document/migration.sql, src/services/document.service.ts, src/services/document.service.test.ts

DONE:
- Added `DELETED` to `DocumentStatus` enum. Migration: `ALTER TYPE "DocumentStatus" ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'DELETED'`.
- `deleteDraft`: changed from `db.document.delete()` to `db.document.update({ data: { status: "DELETED" } })`. Row is preserved in DB.
- `listDocuments`: if no status filter, applies `status: { not: DocumentStatus.DELETED }`. If a specific status is requested, uses that value as-is (UI doesn't request DELETED, so deleted items never appear).
- `getDocumentById`: adds `status: { not: DocumentStatus.DELETED }` — GET /api/documents/:id returns 404 for soft-deleted docs.
- Test updated: `deleteDraft` test now asserts `document.update` with `status: "DELETED"` and confirms `document.delete` is NOT called.

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean. npm test — 43/43.

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 6 — Data Integrity Guards

FILES: none changed — all guards already present in src/services/payment.service.ts

VERIFIED:
- payment > amountDue: checked pre-transaction (line 108) + re-checked inside transaction (line 120).
- payment on cancelled document: checked pre-transaction (line 103) + inside transaction (line 118).
- payment on QUOTE/CREDIT_NOTE: checked pre-transaction (lines 101-102).
- double payment idempotency: dedup check within 60s window on (documentId, amount, method, reference, paymentDate), throws "Duplicate payment detected" (lines 124-135).
All guards are transactionally safe (status re-checked inside `db.$transaction`).

---

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 5 — Business Identity Validation

FILES: src/lib/validations/business.ts, src/app/(dashboard)/settings/BusinessSettingsForm.tsx

DONE:
- `taxId` in businessSchema changed from optional string to `z.string().min(1, "מספר עוסק / ח.פ חובה")`. PATCH /api/business now returns 422 if taxId is empty/missing.
- `name` already required (min(1)). No change needed.
- Issue blocking (Task 4 already covers this): `issueDraft` throws `VALIDATION:מספר עוסק / ח.פ חסר` when business.taxId is blank.
- UI: taxId label now shows asterisk "מספר עוסק / ח.פ. *".

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean. npm test — 43/43.

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 4 — Required Fields Enforcement

FILES: src/services/document.service.ts, src/app/api/documents/[id]/issue/route.ts, src/services/document.service.test.ts

DONE:
- `issueDraft` now loads items in the pre-transaction `findFirst` (via `include: { items: { select: { id: true } } }`).
- Validates BEFORE entering the transaction: business.name present, business.taxId present, doc.issueDate present, doc.items.length > 0.
- Errors accumulate in a `validationErrors` array; if any fail, throws `VALIDATION:{error1} | {error2}`.
- Issue route: maps `VALIDATION:` → 422, strips prefix for the client (Hebrew messages sent as-is).
- `NUMBERING_CONFLICT:` prefix also stripped → "מספור כפול — נסה שנית".
- Tests updated: all `issueDraft` mocks now include `items: [{ id: "item-1" }]`, `issueDate` set, `taxId: "515151"`.

VERIFICATION: npm test — 43/43. npx tsc --noEmit — clean.

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 3 — Audit Log

FILES:
- prisma/schema.prisma (AuditLog model added)
- prisma/migrations/20260412000003_add_audit_log/migration.sql (new)
- src/services/audit.service.ts (new)
- src/app/api/documents/route.ts (auditDocumentCreate wired)
- src/app/api/documents/[id]/issue/route.ts (auditDocumentIssue wired)
- src/app/api/documents/[id]/cancel/route.ts (auditDocumentCancel wired)
- src/app/api/payments/route.ts (auditPaymentAdd wired)
- src/app/api/payments/[id]/route.ts (auditPaymentDelete wired)
- src/services/payment.service.ts (deletePayment now returns the deleted payment for audit)

DONE:
- AuditLog table: id, entityType, entityId, action, userId?, businessId, payload (JSONB), createdAt. Indexed on businessId and (entityType, entityId).
- audit.service.ts: `audit()` is a fire-and-forget wrapper — always void, errors swallowed and logged to console.error. Five public helpers: auditDocumentCreate, auditDocumentIssue, auditDocumentCancel, auditPaymentAdd, auditPaymentDelete. Each passes a lightweight payload (type/number/amount/method).
- Logging never blocks main flow — all calls are fire-and-forget.

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean. npm test — 43/43.

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 2 — Sequential Numbering Hardening

FILES: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/20260412000002_document_number_unique/migration.sql, src/services/document.service.ts, src/app/api/documents/[id]/issue/route.ts

DONE:
- **Already correct (verified):** `issueDraft` uses `db.$transaction` — counter upsert + increment + document update are atomic. Number is assigned only inside the transaction that also sets status=ISSUED. A failed transaction rolls back the counter increment. Status is re-checked inside the transaction to block double-issue races.
- **Added:** `@@unique([businessId, number])` on the `Document` model in schema.prisma. Migration creates `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Document_businessId_number_key" ON "Document"("businessId", "number")`. PostgreSQL naturally allows multiple NULLs in a unique index — DRAFT documents (number=null) are unaffected; only issued documents with the same (businessId, number) pair are rejected.
- **Error handling:** `issueDraft` now catches `P2002` (unique constraint violation) and throws `NUMBERING_CONFLICT:Document number already exists — issue aborted`. Issue route maps `NUMBERING_CONFLICT:` → 409.
- `prisma generate` run — client types updated.

VERIFICATION: npx tsc --noEmit — clean (0 errors).

## [2026-04-12] Compliance Task 1 — Document Immutability

FILES: src/services/document.service.ts, src/app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts, src/services/document.service.test.ts

DONE:
- Service layer: `updateDraft` and `deleteDraft` now throw `IMMUTABLE:Document status is {status} — only DRAFT documents can be {edited|deleted}`. The `IMMUTABLE:` prefix is the machine-readable tag for callers.
- API layer: PATCH and DELETE routes load the document first (via `getDocumentById`). If status != DRAFT → return 409 with Hebrew error message before the service is even called. Defense-in-depth: API check + service check both enforce immutability independently.
- `errorStatus()` helper maps `IMMUTABLE:` → 409, "Only drafts" → 400, "not found" → 404.
- Cancel (status → CANCELLED) and credit note creation routes are unaffected — they have their own dedicated routes with appropriate guards.
- Tests updated to match new `IMMUTABLE:` error prefix.

VERIFICATION: npm run build — clean. npm test — 43/43.

## [2026-04-12] Phase: Compliance Hardening — all 4 tasks complete

AREA: Compliance / Financial Integrity

---

### Task 1 — Document Hash

* Done: SHA256 integrity hash added to every issued document.
* How: `computeIssuedDocumentHash()` in `document.service.ts` serialises type, number, issueDate, dueDate, customer snapshot, business snapshot, all item line fields (sorted by lineIndex), and totals into a canonical JSON string; SHA256 hex digest stored in `issuedHash CHAR(64)` on the Document record.
* Computed inside `issueDraft()` — only at issue time, never recomputed.
* Schema: `issuedHash String? @db.Char(64)` added to Document model.
* Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260412100000_add_document_issued_hash/migration.sql`
* Files: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/services/document.service.ts`

---

### Task 2 — Audit Log Immutability (DB-level)

* Done: PostgreSQL triggers prevent UPDATE and DELETE on the AuditLog table.
* Trigger function `prevent_audit_log_mutation()` raises an EXCEPTION for any UPDATE or DELETE attempt, including direct SQL access bypassing the ORM.
* Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260412100001_audit_log_immutability/migration.sql`
* Files: migration SQL only (no application code changes needed — service was already INSERT-only)

---

### Task 3 — DB-Level Document Protection

* Done: PostgreSQL trigger prevents physical DELETE of Document rows in financial states (ISSUED, PARTIALLY_PAID, PAID, CANCELLED).
* DRAFT and DELETED rows are not blocked — administrative purge of never-issued drafts remains possible.
* Trigger function `prevent_financial_document_delete()` raises an EXCEPTION with the document id and status on any blocked DELETE.
* Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260412100002_document_deletion_protection/migration.sql`
* Files: migration SQL only (no application code changes — app already uses soft-delete)

---

### Task 4 — Retention / Backup Policy

* Done: README updated with a new "Data Retention Policy" section documenting the 7-year retention requirement, what data it covers, DB-level safeguards, and off-site archival guidance including an S3 Glacier cron example.
* Backup script updated with a retention policy comment block explaining the 30-dump local rotation and the requirement for long-term off-site archival.
* Files: `README.md`, `scripts/db-backup.sh`

VERIFICATION: `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean, 0 errors.

## [2026-04-29] WhatsApp Redirect After Quote Approval

AREA: Customer flow / owner notification

### What changed

After a customer approves a quote, the success response now includes a
`https://wa.me/...` URL that opens a WhatsApp chat with the business owner
pre-filled with a Hebrew approval message. The client redirects via
`window.location.href` immediately after the success state is set. Calendar
event creation still runs first and is unaffected.

### Files

* `src/lib/documents/delivery.ts` — new `buildOwnerApprovalRedirectWhatsappMessage()`
  helper. Reuses the existing `normalizeWhatsappPhone()` (`050X → 972X`,
  `+972 → 972`, strips non-digits) and `buildWhatsappShareUrl()`.
* `src/lib/documents/delivery.test.ts` — added test asserting the exact
  message format and the em-dash (`—`) fallbacks.
* `src/services/document.service.ts` — `recordQuoteApproval()` now also
  returns `whatsappRedirectUrl: string | null`. Built by a new private
  `buildOwnerApprovalWhatsappRedirectUrl()` that:
  * loads `business.phone`, document `customerName`/`eventDate`/`eventTime`,
    and the customer phone,
  * formats `eventDate` via existing `formatDate()` and `eventTime` via
    `formatEventTime()`,
  * returns `null` if `business.phone` is missing — in that case the route
    keeps the existing success response with no redirect.
* `src/app/api/public/approve/[token]/route.ts` — passes
  `whatsappRedirectUrl` through to the JSON response.
* `src/app/approve/[token]/ApprovalForm.tsx` — when the response includes
  `whatsappRedirectUrl`, the success view sets `window.location.href = url`
  right after rendering success.

### Message format

```
הי ליאור
הצעת מחיר אושרה ✅

לקוח: {customerName}
טלפון: {customerPhone}
תאריך האירוע: {eventDate}
שעה: {eventTime}
```

Each missing field falls back to `—`.

### Constraints honored

* Approval still succeeds if WhatsApp URL build throws — wrapped in try/catch
  with a safe `console.error("[approval] build whatsapp redirect failed", error)`.
* Calendar creation runs before WhatsApp URL build and is not blocked by it.
* No external libraries; phone normalization reuses the existing util.
* Note: `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` referenced in the task brief
  do not exist in this repo — work proceeded with `docs/RUNNING_SUMMARY.md`
  and the existing source as the source of truth.

### Verification

* `npm test` — 6 suites / 59 tests pass (1 new test added in delivery suite).
* `npm run build` — succeeds. Pre-existing `Dynamic server usage` notices on
  unrelated `/api/reports/*` routes are unchanged.
